# Weather App (React)

Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to search for current weather information by city name.  
The application fetches real-time data from a public weather API and displays essential weather details in a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project was created as a learning and portfolio project to demonstrate practical React and API integration skills.
